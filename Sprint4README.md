We have a mini-shell implemented where you can make different graphs and other commands related to graphs.

20 of the most retweeted people were assigned stances, many tend towards the negative as that's what the dataset represents.

How to Run:
Graph Shell: java -jar target/3Branch-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -graph
Tweet Gathering: java -jar target/3Branch-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -g

All the commands for the graph shell can be found in the source files
