1507783696761462788	@o_burbidge	Weirdest symptom I'm having of covid is what I would call 'rebooting'.  I can be fully functioning one minute, the next I basically have 10 seconds to get horizontal.  The minute I do, my eyes shut & I'm asleep.  It's as if I go from 100% battery to 0% in seconds. #Covid #Omicron	0	Sat Mar 26 18:17:01 GMT 2022

1507783723600732160	@tambreleighn	One more reason to #WearAMask. When you #Maskup, you reduce your risk of not only #COVID19 & the #flu, but the combination. Having both at once is 4 times more likely to put you on life support & twice as likely to be fatal compared to #Covid by itself.	22	Sat Mar 26 18:17:07 GMT 2022

1508164858700869633	@lucia_ciampa	So many people seem to be getting verbally abused for wearing a mask in public. It's strange how the anti-maskers were the ones going on about "personal choice" yet they can't seem to take it when that choice is different to their own.

1508164899616215048	@ferguson2811	Actually, the UK data - Imperial and Cambridge analysis- shows that hospitalisation rates are comparable between delta & omicron in children under 10.

1508169862664933382	@AnitaKattinger	Actually, the UK data - Imperial and Cambridge analysis- shows that hospitalisation rates are comparable between delta & omicron in children under 10.  Also, ultimately it's the absolute risk to children that matters - which is clearly higher due to high infection.	256	Sun Mar 27 20:51:30 BST 2022
