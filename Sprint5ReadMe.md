"build user to hashtag" builds a user to hashtag graph.<br>
"assign stances" initialises stances to the current graph.<br>
"add graph" adds the current graph to a list for further bootstrapping.<br>
"build retweet" builds a retweet graph and "assign stances" and "add graph" also works on it as well.<br>
So the choice between bootstrapping and user to hashtag graph onto a retweet graph or vice versa is up to the user.

"combine graphs" combines the graph based on the order that they were added.

"print coverage" prints the coverage and other data to terminal.<br>
"write" writes the current graph to file.<br>
